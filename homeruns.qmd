# Introduction

## Historical View of Home Runs

-   Baseball Reference provides the average number of Home Runs, Hits, Runs for each team each game during all seasons of Major League Baseball (1871 through 2023)

-   Home Run hitting has gone through many changes in MLB History

## Avg HR Hit Per Team Per Game

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
br <- read_csv("data/br_seasons0.csv")
ggplot(br,
       aes(Year, HR)) +
  geom_point(color = "black", size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(formula = "y ~ x", color = "blue",
              se = FALSE, method = "loess",
              span = 0.20, linewidth = 1.5) +
  labs(x = "Season", y = "Avg HR") +
  theme(text=element_text(size=22))
```

## A Plate Appearance

Three Basic Outcomes:

-   Strikeout
-   Walk
-   Ball put into play

How have the rates of these three outcomes changed over the last 50 years of baseball?

## History of In-Play, SO and BB Rates

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
br <- read_csv("data/br_seasons.csv")
br %>% 
  mutate(Rate = SO / PA, Type = "Strikeout") %>% 
  select(Type, Year, Rate) -> br1
br %>% 
  mutate(Rate = BB / PA, Type = "Walk") %>% 
  select(Type, Year, Rate) -> br2
br %>% 
  mutate(Rate = (AB - SO) / PA, Type = "In-Play") %>% 
  select(Type, Year, Rate) -> br3
ggplot(filter(rbind(br1, br2, br3), Year >= 1960),
       aes(Year, Rate)) +
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 2) +
  geom_smooth(formula = "y ~ x", color = "blue",
              se = FALSE, method = "loess",
              span = 0.30, linewidth = 1) +
  labs(x = "Season", y = "Rate") +
  theme(text=element_text(size=18)) +
  facet_wrap(~ Type, ncol = 1, scales = "free_y") +
  theme(aspect.ratio=2/9)
```

## History of Rates

-   SO Rates have been steadily increasing

-   In-Play Rates have been decreasing

-   Pattern of Walk Rates are less clear, show up and down movement

## In-Play Rates

-   Define the home run rate as the fraction of $HR$ among all batted balls ($AB - SO$)$$
HR \, Rate = \frac{HR}{AB - SO}
$$

-   Look at history of $HR$ rates

## History of HR Rates

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
br <- read_csv("data/br_seasons.csv")
ggplot(filter(br, Year >= 1960),
       aes(Year, HR / (AB - SO))) +
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 3) +
  geom_smooth(formula = "y ~ x", color = "blue",
              se = FALSE, method = "loess",
              span = 0.30, linewidth = 1.5) +
  labs(x = "Season", y = "HR Rate") +
  theme(text=element_text(size=18))
```

# What is Causing the Increase in Home Rate Rates?

## MLB Committee

-   Fall of 2017 a committee was charged by Major League Baseball to identify the potential causes of the increase in the rate at which home runs were hit in 2015, 2016, and 2017.

-   Report was released in May 2018.

## Possible Reasons for Increase in HRs

The batters?

-   Changes in characteristics of batted balls
-   Launch angle, exit velocity, and spray angle

The pitchers?

-   Changes in types of pitches
-   Pitch location

## Possible Reasons for Increase in HRs

The ball?

-   Changes in how the ball is made?
-   Seam height, core?
-   Drag coefficient?

## Possible Reasons for Increase in HRs

Game conditions?

-   Ballpark effect
-   Weather
-   Cold vs. hot temperatures

## Process of Hitting a Ball

-   **IN-PLAY**: Have to put the ball in play

-   **HIT IT RIGHT**: The batted ball needs to have the "right" launch angle and exit velocity

-   **REACH THE SEATS:** Given the exit velocity and launch angle, needs to have sufficient distance and height to clear the fence (the carry of ball)

## Committe's Findings (2015-2017 Data)

-   Found modest changes in launch angle and exit velocity among batters
-   Focused on RED zone -- launch angle in (15, 40) degrees, launch speed between 90 and 115 mpg
-   The RED zone balls are showing more carry -- they travel further

## Committee's Findings

-   Increase in home runs is due to better carry (less drag) for given launch conditions
-   Likely due to the aerodynamic properties of the baseball
-   Didn't appear to be a property of the manufactured baseballs
-   Recommend that MLB monitor the climate environment of the baseballs

# Recent Exploration of Home Run Rates

## End of 2023 Season

-   Nine seasons of Statcast data (2015 - 2023) are available
-   Have launch speed and launch angle measurements for all seasons
-   Take a broader perspective on home run hitting

## Empirical Approach

-   Look at region of launch angle and exit velocity where most of home runs are hit
-   Look at rate of batted balls in this region -- how does it vary by season?
-   Look at rate of home runs for balls hit in this region -- how does it vary season?

## Launch Vars Where Most HR are Hit (RED Zone)

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
scip_nine_years <- read_rds("data/sc_bips_nine_years.rds")
sc_hr <- filter(scip_nine_years, events == "home_run")

ggplot(sample_n(sc_hr, size = 5000),
       aes(launch_angle, launch_speed)) +
  geom_point() +
  xlim(15, 50) +
  ylim(c(90, 115)) +
  annotate("rect", xmin = 20, xmax = 35, 
           ymin = 95, ymax = 110,
           alpha = .5,fill = "pink") +
  theme(text=element_text(size=18)) +
  labs(x = "Launch Angle", y = "Exit Velocity") +
  theme(aspect.ratio=0.7)
```

## Balls in Play Rate

-   Interested in rate of "home run likely" (RED Zone) batted balls $$
    BIP \, Rate = \frac{HR \, Likely}{BIP}
    $$
-   Are batters changing their approach?
-   Players getting stronger?

## Rate of Balls Hit in RED Zone

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(lubridate)
scip_nine_years <- read_rds("data/sc_bips_nine_years.rds")
scip_nine_years %>% 
  mutate(RED = ifelse(launch_angle >= 20 &
                      launch_angle <= 35 &
                      launch_speed >= 95 &
                      launch_speed <= 110, 1, 0),
         Season = year(game_date)) ->
           scip_nine_years
scip_nine_years %>% 
  group_by(Season) %>% 
  summarize(BIP = n(),
            RED = sum(RED, na.rm = TRUE),
            HR = sum(events == "home_run"))  %>% 
  mutate(RED_Rate = 100 * RED / BIP,
         HR_Rate = 100 * HR / RED) -> S
ggplot(S, aes(Season, RED_Rate)) +
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 4) +
  theme(text=element_text(size=18)) +
  labs(y = "Rate in RED Zone")
```

## Rate of Balls Hit in RED Zone

-   See a general increase in "home run likely" rates over Statcast period
-   Players appear to be changing their hitting approach or they are getting stronger

## Home Run Rate in RED Zone

-   What is the chance of a home run given good values of launch angle and exit velocity? $$
    HR \, Rate = \frac{HR} {HR \,Likely}
    $$
-   Characteristic of the baseball
-   Changes in drag coefficient over seasons?

## Home Run Rate in RED Zone

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(readr)
library(lubridate)
scip_nine_years <- read_rds("data/sc_bips_nine_years.rds")
scip_nine_years %>% 
  mutate(RED = ifelse(launch_angle >= 20 &
                      launch_angle <= 35 &
                      launch_speed >= 95 &
                      launch_speed <= 110, 1, 0),
         Season = year(game_date)) ->
           scip_nine_years
scip_nine_years %>% 
  group_by(Season) %>% 
  summarize(BIP = n(),
            RED = sum(RED, na.rm = TRUE),
            HR = sum(events == "home_run"))  %>% 
  mutate(RED_Rate = 100 * RED / BIP,
         HR_Rate = 100 * HR / RED) -> S
ggplot(S, aes(Season, HR_Rate)) +
  geom_point(color = "red", size = 4) +
  theme(text=element_text(size=18)) +
  labs(y = "HR Rate in RED Zone")
```

## Home Run Rate in RED Zone

-   General increase from 2015 to 2017
-   Big dip in 2018, followed by big increase in 2019
-   General decrease from 2019 to 2023
-   Interpretation

## Focus on Two Seasons: 2021 and 2023

```{r}
#| echo: false
df <- tibble(Season = c(2021, 2023),
                 HR_Total = c(5944, 5868),
                 HR_Per_Game_Per_Team = c(1.22, 1.21))
knitr::kable(df, "simple",
             align = "lcc",
             col.names = c("Season", "Home Runs",
                           "HR Per Game Per Team"))
```

- On the surface, the two seasons were similar with respect to home run hitting.


## A Closer Look

-   Divide region of launch angle and exit velocity into subregions
-   Focus on 2021 and 2023 seasons
-   Look at changes in batted ball rate and home run rate in each region
-   Use logit scale

## A Logit

-   If $P$ is a rate, then the logit of $P$ is $$
    logit \, P = \log\left(\frac{P}{1-P}\right)
    $$

-   When comparing two rates, say $P_1$ and $P_2$, better to compare on logit scale:$$
\log\left(\frac{P_2}{1-P_2}\right) -
\log\left(\frac{P_1}{1-P_1}\right)
$$

## Why Logit?

- Proportions have a variation issue -- proportions near 0 and 1 have smaller variability than proportions close to 0.5.

- Logits tend to fix this variability issue.

- Logits have similar variability across all proportion values.

## Logits Stretch the Scale for Proportions Close to 0 and 1

```{r}
#| echo: false
require(dplyr)
require(ggplot2)
df <- tibble(p = seq(.01, .99, length.out = 200)) |> 
  mutate(Logit = log(p / (1 - p)))
ggplot(df, aes(p, Logit)) + geom_line(color = "red",
                                      linewidth = 2) + 
  ggtitle("The Logit Function") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(colour = "blue", size = 18,
                hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.8, angle = 0)) +
  theme(text=element_text(size=18))
```

## Interpreting Difference in Logits

-   Suppose we compare two seasons
$$
\log\left(\frac{P_{season \, 2}}{1-P_{season \, 2}}\right) -
\log\left(\frac{P_{season \, 1}}{1-P_{season \, 1}}\right)
$$

-   If the difference is positive, rate is higher in Season 2

-   If the difference is negative, rate is lower in Season 2

## Example - Comparing 2021 and 2023 Rates

-   Divide launch angles from 20 to 40 degrees into 4 bins

-   Divide exit velocities from 95 to 110 mph into 3 bins

-   So there are 4 x 3 = 12 subregions

-   Compare 2021 and 2023 Batted Ball Rates in each region

-   Compare 2021 and 2023 Home Run Rates in each region

## Comparing Batted Ball Rates

```{r, echo = FALSE}
source("R/compare_logits.R")
library(readr)
scip_nine_years <- read_rds("data/sc_bips_nine_years.rds")
out <- compare_logits(scip_nine_years, 2021, 2023)
out[[1]]
```

## Comparing Batted Ball Rates

-   Some increase in batted ball rates in 2023 (compared with 2021) for high exit velocities and launch angles smaller than 30 degrees.

-   Harder to compare batted ball rates in two seasons for launch angles larger than 30 degrees.

## Comparing Home Run Rates

```{r, echo = FALSE}
source("R/compare_logits.R")
library(readr)
scip_nine_years <- read_rds("data/sc_bips_nine_years.rds")
out <- compare_logits(scip_nine_years, 2021, 2023)
out[[2]]
```

## Comparing Home Run Rates

-   For most of the bins for 105 mph or smaller, there was a smaller home run rate in 2023 compared to 2021.

-   This is especially apparent for exit velocities between 100 and 105 mph.

-   A dead ball was used in 2023 (relative to 2021).

## Comparing 2021 and 2023

- On the surface, home run rates were similar in two seasons.

- But we see an 2023 increase in rate of "home run friendly" batted balls.

- This increase is offset by use of a slightly deader ball in 2023.


## Concluding Comments

-   Many factors influence home run hitting.

-   Two important factors are the hitters (values of launch variables) and the ball (carry or drag coefficient).

-   It is helpful to monitor the Balls-in-Play and Home Run rates to see the effects due to the hitters and the ball.

## Concluding Comments (Continued)

-   Batters are stronger and changing their hitting approach, leading to higher rates of "HR friendly" balls in play.

-   The composition of the ball has gone through dramatic changes during the Statcast era.

- Currently the ball is relatively dead compared to previous seasons.
